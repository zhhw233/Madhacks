This is a tool to determine where and how old you are based off of the sound, pitch, 
and accent that your voice carries. This is a neat way to discover whether or not your 
voice actually matches your appearance!

How It works:
Records a snippet of your audio (up to 30 seconds) and sends it to the backend "XGBoosting.py"
where it then determines what country your accent comes from, your approximate age range, 
and your gender.

For privacy and storage reasons, vocal data is not stored.
